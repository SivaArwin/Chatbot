# Chatbot
Created a chatbot with voice output using tflearn,and flask.
<hr>

# Need to install the required packages in requirment.txt
<hr>

## Its a web app, deployed using flask and some confusing java scripts.
## Used tflearn which is an older version and works with lower version of tensorflow, Tensorflow 2.0 and above are not supported
## Need to run the the run.py file and now you are good to go. 
Enjoy the app
